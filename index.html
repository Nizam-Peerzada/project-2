        <p>Not only is the <b>Beagle</b> an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and'¿
            thanks to its pleading expression'¿cute. They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are
            generally easygoing.
            There are two<b>Beagle</b>  varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15
            inches. Both varieties
            are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches,' as dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors as
            lemon, red and white, and
            tricolor. The <b>Beagle's</b> fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long,
            houndy ears set low on a
            broad head. A breed described as 'merry' by its fanciers,<b> Beagles</b> are loving and lovable, happy, and
            companionable'¿all qualities
            that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the<b> Beagle</b> has been the most popular hound
            dog among American pet
            owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime.<br>
